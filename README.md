ABOUT THE APP:

How many times have you copy-pasted source code from one place into another, just to see later that it doesn't work the same, or as intended? I've done it countless times. This is why I created this app, so I don't have to compare the code blocks myself, but to automatize it. Now, you may wonder, why not just paste the code itself from one place to the other? While coding, there's many times where you have different iterations of a function - for example at moment 1 it does basic intended instructions, at moment 2 it does the basic instructions + some improvements but with some new found bugs. You may want to tell which are the differences in the code where the improvements/bugs happen.

Currently, the app just tells if 2 strings are the same. In the next update I'm looking forward to also highlight the differences from one string to another.

HOW TO USE THE APP:

Enter your code blocks in the respective text areas.
Click "COMPARE". A pop-up will show with the result.
If you want to add another code blocks, don't just manually select and delete the strings. Use the "CLEAR" button.
When you're done using the app, you can either close it by using the inbuilt "QUIT" button, or by using the window's "X" close button.
